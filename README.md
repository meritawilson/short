to create a plugin in gedit text editor 
i am an engineering student doing my 2 nd year in BTECH IT.
i am new to programming.i am here to do my miniproject .
i wish to create a plugin for text editor which help the beginners to make c program simplified.
(ie) .p-printf("",);
.p gives syntax for printf() and so on.
